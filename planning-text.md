Now I want you to help me flesh out the sections. Much like Theo's thesis, I want to have explanations of what I have done in concrete terms so that readers of my CV understand my skills.

I want you to add bullet points to the PhD section.

I want you to explain and carefully phrase that:
* my research has made use of new technology to make accessible data sources in economic history that would be impossible to use at scale without using new technology including large language models, computer vision models, and text embedding models.
* In my research, I designed a novel AI pipeline to transform text data from historical biographical dictionaries into a machine readable format, placed them in a database, and analysed the output. Building the pipeline saved 3 months work of transcription time at low cost, and allowed me to reach a scale of observations that is larger than previous studies.
* Each of my thesis papers uses different kinds of data; the first is a systematic review of the literature, the second uses cross section historical census data, the third uses biographic text data, and the final paper uses networks of corporate directors as well as company records as time series data. 

In my work at Codera, I want you to explain the project that I delivered:
* it involved project planning, bidding on, winning and then delivering a pipeline to collect, classify, and extract data from a wealth of documents on public finance on the African continent. 
* this involved writing more than 60 web scrapers to collect PDF budget documents from various institutions, 
* creating a classifier with the help of a multimodal large language model to classify the documents
* extracting metadata about these documents and storing this in a database
* Creating an internal tool for the client to understand the coverage of the data that they have collected since 2013 to the present day.
